I am currently at liberty diving in the ocean of Computer Vison and Deep Learning, and have found they are extremely charming. \**wink*\* 

Before that, I was a Software Engineer who does what a Software Engineers do. 
Before that I went to Columbia University majoring Computer Engineering, earned a Master degree.
Before that I went to Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications majoring Telecommunication Systems with Managements, earned a Bachelor degree, in the mean time, I also went to Queen Mary, University of London which provides a joint program with BUPT, earned another Bachelor degree.

Long before that, I'm a Photoshop fanatic during my Junior High, and built a website for PS learners which had dead over a decade ago.
